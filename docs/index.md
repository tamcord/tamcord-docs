### What is Fosscord?

Fosscord is a free open source self-hostable discord compatible chat, voice and video platform.

## Philosophy

Fosscord aims to be a full one-on-one clone of Discord, adding more features
that can be used as a replacement for the official client and still connect to
discord.com and host private Fosscord server instances.

Fosscord aims to give the best possible user experience, while being backwards
compatible to Discord's features and adding new ones/improving old ones while
maintaining the user privacy with end-to-end encryption support.

The client can connect to multiple server instances without the need to open it
multiple times.

The client should be extensible through a secure Plugin and Theme System with
own store.

The server should be extensible through bots, just like discord without the need
to change anything except the api endpoint.

The project is open source so everyone can have a look what's going on under the
hood and can be maintained and expanded by the community.

Everything is configurable in the server config and everyone can add their own
features, so that it is not opinionated.

### Concept

### Why backwards compatible to Discord?

- Benefit from the large user base of discord -> more users, making the switch
  easier for new users & keeping workflows intact and easily migrating existing discord bots
- No disadvantage for the users who use fosscord, so that they can still
  communicate with all their peers who use discord
- Discord has already built a great and stable protocol _(don't reinvent the
  wheel)_
- The community can extend and customize their clients and servers by
  self-hosting them and developing and installing addons

## Support

[Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZrnGQP6p3d)

Once we are finished, we'll host our own instance to host the support server.
