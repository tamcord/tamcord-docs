# Themes

## Philosophy

-   Themes should look the same on all platforms.
-   Themes should be made with an visual theme editor to easily create and edit your own themes.
-   Themes should be combinable to use multiple themes at once.
-   Themes should be installed and submitted through a theme store with voting options.
-   Guilds should be able to specify their own themes for compatible clients.
