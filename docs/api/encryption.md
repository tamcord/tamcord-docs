# Encryption

## Philosophy

Everything should be end-to-end encrypted by default.

Everything should be configurable by the user/admin to their security needs.

Once encryption is enabled you can't disable it anymore. _(Plain text channels need be created as such)_

End to end encryption should also be possible on unsupported servers e.g. discord.com. _(through special formatted messages)_

Based on the concept that the server cannot be trusted and could be compromised.
